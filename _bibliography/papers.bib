      abstract={The Storage Location Assignment Problem (SLAP) and the Picker Routing Problem (PRP) have received significant attention in the literature due to their pivotal role in the performance of the Order Picking (OP) activity, the most resource-intensive process of warehousing logistics. The two problems are traditionally considered at different decision-making levels: tactical for the SLAP, and operational for the PRP. However, this paradigm has been challenged by the emergence of modern practices in e-commerce warehouses, where decisions are more dynamic. This shift makes the integrated problem, called the Storage Location Assignment and Picker Routing Problem (SLAPRP), pertinent to consider. Scholars have investigated several variants of the SLAPRP, including different warehouse layouts and routing policies. Nevertheless, the available computational results suggest that each variant requires an ad-hoc formulation. Moreover, achieving a complete integration of the two problems, where the routing is solved optimally, remains out of reach for commercial solvers, even on trivial instances.

In this paper, we propose an exact solution framework that addresses a broad class of variants of the SLAPRP, including all the previously existing ones. This paper proposes a Branch-Cut-and-Price framework based on a novel formulation with an exponential number of variables, which is strengthened with a novel family of non-robust valid inequalities. We have developed an ad-hoc branching scheme to break symmetries and maintain the size of the enumeration tree manageable. Computational experiments show that our framework can effectively solve medium-sized instances of several SLAPRP variants and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods from the literature.}

      abstract={The Picker Routing Problem (PRP), which consists in finding a minimum-length tour between a set of storage locations in a warehouse, is one of the most important problems in the warehousing logistics literature. Despite its popularity, the tractability of the PRP in conventional multi-block warehouses remains an open question. This technical note aims to fill this research gap by establishing that the PRP is strongly NP-hard. }

This paper is the first part of a work that aims at reviewing the efforts dedicated by the OR community to the integration of human factors into logistics and manufacturing systems. A focus is put on the modeling and solution approaches used to consider human characteristics, their practical relevance, and the complexity induced by their integration within optimization models. The material presented in this work has been retrieved through a semi-systematic search of the literature. Then, a comprehensive analysis of the retrieved corpus is carried out to map the related literature by class of problems encountered in logistics and manufacturing. These include warehousing, vehicle routing, scheduling, production planning, and workforce scheduling and management. We investigate the mathematical programming techniques used to integrate human factors into optimization models. Finally, a number of gaps in the literature are identified, and new suggestions on how to suitably integrate human factors in OR problems encountered in logistics and manufacturing systems are discussed.}

This paper is the second part of a work that aims at reviewing the efforts dedicated by the OR community to the integration of human aspects into logistics and manufacturing systems. A focus is put on the models proposed to represent and quantify human characteristics, their practical relevance, and the complexity induced by their integration with mathematical optimization models. In this paper, the techniques used in the OR literature to represent the human considerations encountered in logistics and manufacturing systems are surveyed. The existing Human-Aware Models (HAM) are classified and reviewed by domain. Particular attention is paid to the field validity of each method, its relevance to specific use cases, the required data collection, and its usability within mathematical optimization models. Since the surveyed HAMs rely on concepts originating from different related scientific disciplines (e.g., ergonomics, occupational medicine), a brief introduction of these fields of study is proposed together with a work of contextualization that is carried out during the analysis.}
