      abstract={The Picker Routing Problem (PRP), which consists in finding a minimum-length tour between a set of storage locations in a warehouse, is one of the most important problems in the warehousing logistics literature. Despite its popularity, the tractability of the PRP in conventional multi-block warehouses remains an open question. This technical note aims to fill this research gap by establishing that the PRP is strongly NP-hard. }

Since the early 2000s, human considerations are gaining increasing attention, pushed by the growing societal concerns of sustainable development on the same terms as the economic and ecological ones. This paper is the first part of a work that aims at reviewing the efforts dedicated by the OR community to the integration of human factors into logistics and manufacturing systems. A focus is put on the modeling and solution approaches used to consider human characteristics, their practical relevance, and the complexity induced by their integration within optimization models. The material presented in this work has been retrieved through a semi-systematic search of the literature. Then, a comprehensive analysis of the retrieved corpus is carried out to map the related literature by class of problems encountered in logistics and manufacturing. These include warehousing, vehicle routing, scheduling, production planning, and workforce scheduling and management. We investigate the mathematical programming techniques used to integrate human factors into optimization models. Finally, a number of gaps in the literature are identified, and new suggestions on how to suitably integrate human factors in OR problems encountered in logistics and manufacturing systems are discussed.}

This paper is the second part of a work that aims at reviewing the efforts dedicated by the OR community to the integration of human aspects into logistics and manufacturing systems. A focus is put on the models proposed to represent and quantify human characteristics, their practical relevance, and the complexity induced by their integration with mathematical optimization models. In this paper, the techniques used in the OR literature to represent the human considerations encountered in logistics and manufacturing systems are surveyed. The existing Human-Aware Models (HAM) are classified and reviewed by domain. Particular attention is paid to the field validity of each method, its relevance to specific use cases, the required data collection, and its usability within mathematical optimization models. Since the surveyed HAMs rely on concepts originating from different related scientific disciplines (e.g., ergonomics, occupational medicine), a brief introduction of these fields of study is proposed together with a work of contextualization that is carried out during t
