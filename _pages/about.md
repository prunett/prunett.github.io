I am a postdoctoral researcher in operations research and machine learning at [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) in the group of [Axel Parmentier](https://axelparmentier.github.io/).

Between 2020 and 2023, I did my PhD at [Mines Saint-Etienne](https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/) and [LIMOS](https://limos.fr/) under the supervision of [Nabil Absi](http://absi.nabil.free.fr/), Valeria Borodin and [Diego Cattaruzza](https://sites.google.com/site/cattaruzzaxdiego/). My thesis focused on the integrated optimization of order picking decisions in warehousing logistics. As a second research direction, we studied the integration of human factors and ergonomics in the optimization of logistics and manufacturing systems.

My research interests span the theory, methods and algorithms of operations research and machine learning applied to the optimization of supply chain and logistic systems.
